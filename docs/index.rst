   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

scikit-allel (version 2)
========================

This is an early work in progress. scikit-allel version 2 will
eventually replace version 1, however it will take some time to reach
feature parity. In the mean time, see the documentation for
`scikit-allel (version 1) <http://scikit-allel.readthedocs.org>`_ if
you need a more complete set of capabilities.

If you want to try scikit-allel version 2, install with::

    $ pip install --pre skallel

You can install scikit-allel version 2 alongside version 1, they will
not interfere with each other. scikit-allel version 2 uses the new
``skallel`` namespace, whereas scikit-allel version 1 uses the
``allel`` namespace.
